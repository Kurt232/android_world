Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.\n- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. \n- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.\n- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from \"up\", 'down\", \"left\", \"right\". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, \"down\"\n- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.\n- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include \"selected\", \"checked\", \"scrollable\", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])[\"selected\"].\n- back(): close the current window\n\n\nThe <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:\n- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button\n- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]\n\nThe <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:\n- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items\n- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match(\"key words\") or $my_items.match({\"selected\": true})\nYou can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.\n\nThe first state of the app has the following important UI elements: \n\topen_note\n\tcreate_note\n\tmore_options_checklist\n\tswitch_item\n\tswitch_to_prev_item\n\titem_title\n\tswitch_to_next_item\n\tchecklist_item_list\n\tchecklist_item\n\tchecklist_item\n\tadd_checklist_item\n\n\n\nNow I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.\nThe tasks are:\n\nTask 0: Open a checklist note or create one if there is none, then sort the current checklist by title.\nTask 1: Ensure a checklist is open and print the current checklist\nTask 2: Create a note titled 'Meeting Notes' if it doesn't already exist, then delete the 'Meeting Notes' note.\nTask 3: Open the settings of the app and set the font size to 90%\nTask 4: Open a note or create one if there is none, and set the app to place the cursor at the end of the note.\n\nYour answer should follow this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"<task1>\": \"<script1>\",\n    \"<task2>\": \"<script2>\",\n    ...\n}\n\n**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**\n", "10": "A Notes app in smartphone has the following important UI elements:\n\nelement: open_note\n\tDescription: A button \"Open Note\";

Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.\n- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. \n- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.\n- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from \"up\", 'down\", \"left\", \"right\". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, \"down\"\n- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.\n- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include \"selected\", \"checked\", \"scrollable\", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])[\"selected\"].\n- back(): close the current window\n\n\nThe <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:\n- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button\n- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]\n\nThe <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:\n- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items\n- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match(\"key words\") or $my_items.match({\"selected\": true})\nYou can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.\n\nThe first state of the app has the following important UI elements: \n\topen_note\n\tcreate_note\n\tmore_options_checklist\n\tswitch_item\n\tswitch_to_prev_item\n\titem_title\n\tswitch_to_next_item\n\tchecklist_item_list\n\tchecklist_item\n\tchecklist_item\n\tadd_checklist_item\n\n\n\nNow I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.\nThe tasks are:\n\nTask 0: Open the checklist containing the item 'Shopping List' and rename the checklist item 'Shopping List' to 'Groceries List'\nTask 1: If no checklist note is currently open, open one first, and then open more options for the current checklist.\nTask 2: Ensure that a note titled 'Grocery List' exists and is opened, then print the current note about the grocery list.\nTask 3: Open an existing note or create a new one if necessary, then show the title of the current note\nTask 4: Check the current font size\n\nYour answer should follow this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"<task1>\": \"<script1>\",\n    \"<task2>\": \"<script2>\",\n    ...\n}\n\n**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**\n", "15": "A Notes app in smartphone has the following important UI elements:\n\nelement: open_note\n\tDescription: A button \"Open Note\";

Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.\n- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. \n- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.\n- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from \"up\", 'down\", \"left\", \"right\". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, \"down\"\n- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.\n- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include \"selected\", \"checked\", \"scrollable\", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])[\"selected\"].\n- back(): close the current window\n\n\nThe <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:\n- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button\n- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]\n\nThe <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:\n- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items\n- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match(\"key words\") or $my_items.match({\"selected\": true})\nYou can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.\n\nThe first state of the app has the following important UI elements: \n\topen_note\n\tcreate_note\n\tmore_options_checklist\n\tswitch_item\n\tswitch_to_prev_item\n\titem_title\n\tswitch_to_next_item\n\tchecklist_item_list\n\tchecklist_item\n\tchecklist_item\n\tadd_checklist_item\n\n\n\nNow I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.\nThe tasks are:\n\nTask 0: Starting from the home page, open the more options menu for the current checklist\nTask 1: Open settings from a checklist note by first creating a checklist note or opening an existing one.\nTask 2: Create multiple checklist items and then sort the items of the current checklist by Custom\nTask 3: Starting from the home page, open more options for the current checklist\nTask 4: Open a checklist note or create one if there is none, then open more options for the current checklist\n\nYour answer should follow this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"<task1>\": \"<script1>\",\n    \"<task2>\": \"<script2>\",\n    ...\n}\n\n**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**\n", "20": "A Notes app in smartphone has the following important UI elements:\n\nelement: open_note\n\tDescription: A button \"Open Note\";

Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.\n- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. \n- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.\n- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from \"up\", 'down\", \"left\", \"right\". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, \"down\"\n- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.\n- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include \"selected\", \"checked\", \"scrollable\", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])[\"selected\"].\n- back(): close the current window\n\n\nThe <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:\n- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button\n- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]\n\nThe <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:\n- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items\n- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match(\"key words\") or $my_items.match({\"selected\": true})\nYou can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.\n\nThe first state of the app has the following important UI elements: \n\topen_note\n\tcreate_note\n\tmore_options_checklist\n\tswitch_item\n\tswitch_to_prev_item\n\titem_title\n\tswitch_to_next_item\n\tchecklist_item_list\n\tchecklist_item\n\tchecklist_item\n\tadd_checklist_item\n\n\n\nNow I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.\nThe tasks are:\n\nTask 0: Open the settings page in the Notes app and scroll through it.\nTask 1: Create checklist items, mark some as done, and then remove all done items from the current checklist.\nTask 2: Open a checklist note containing 'Meeting at 3PM' if one is not already opened, then rename the checklist item 'Meeting at 3PM' to 'Team Meeting at 3PM'.\nTask 3: Open a checklist note or create one if there is none, then confirm the current checklist sorting type\nTask 4: Open any existing note or create a new note, then enable Incognito mode for keyboards in notes.\n\nYour answer should follow this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"<task1>\": \"<script1>\",\n    \"<task2>\": \"<script2>\",\n    ...\n}\n\n**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**\n", "25": "A Notes app in smartphone has the following important UI elements:\n\nelement: open_note\n\tDescription: A button \"Open Note\";

Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.\n- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. \n- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.\n- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from \"up\", 'down\", \"left\", \"right\". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, \"down\"\n- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.\n- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include \"selected\", \"checked\", \"scrollable\", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])[\"selected\"].\n- back(): close the current window\n\n\nThe <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:\n- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button\n- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]\n\nThe <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:\n- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items\n- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match(\"key words\") or $my_items.match({\"selected\": true})\nYou can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.\n\nThe first state of the app has the following important UI elements: \n\topen_note\n\tcreate_note\n\tmore_options_checklist\n\tswitch_item\n\tswitch_to_prev_item\n\titem_title\n\tswitch_to_next_item\n\tchecklist_item_list\n\tchecklist_item\n\tchecklist_item\n\tadd_checklist_item\n\n\n\nNow I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.\nThe tasks are:\n\nTask 0: Open the current note and then open more options for that note in the Notes APP\nTask 1: Open the note 'Journal Entry' and navigate to the app settings.\nTask 2: Make sure a checklist is open and is the current checklist, then open the more options menu of the current checklist.\nTask 3: Open the 'Christmas shopping' checklist, then delete my 'Christmas shopping checklist'\nTask 4: Ensure a note titled 'Meeting Agenda' exists and create a shortcut for the note.\n\nYour answer should follow this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"<task1>\": \"<script1>\",\n    \"<task2>\": \"<script2>\",\n    ...\n}\n\n**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**\n", "30": "A Notes app in smartphone has the following important UI elements:\n\nelement: open_note\n\tDescription: A button \"Open Note\";

Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.\n- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. \n- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.\n- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from \"up\", 'down\", \"left\", \"right\". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, \"down\"\n- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.\n- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include \"selected\", \"checked\", \"scrollable\", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])[\"selected\"].\n- back(): close the current window\n\n\nThe <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:\n- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button\n- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]\n\nThe <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:\n- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items\n- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match(\"key words\") or $my_items.match({\"selected\": true})\nYou can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.\n\nThe first state of the app has the following important UI elements: \n\topen_note\n\tcreate_note\n\tmore_options_checklist\n\tswitch_item\n\tswitch_to_prev_item\n\titem_title\n\tswitch_to_next_item\n\tchecklist_item_list\n\tchecklist_item\n\tchecklist_item\n\tadd_checklist_item\n\n\n\nNow I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.\nThe tasks are:\n\nTask 0: If a note with the title 'Grocery List' already exists, rename the note title to something else, then create a new checklist note and title it 'Grocery List'\nTask 1: Show the current font size directly from the home page\nTask 2: Open the settings of the notes app\nTask 3: Open a text note or create one if there is none, then search within the current note for the keyword 'deadline'.\nTask 4: Open the more options menu for the current note from the home page.\n\nYour answer should follow this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"<task1>\": \"<script1>\",\n    \"<task2>\": \"<script2>\",\n    ...\n}\n\n**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**\n", "35": "A Notes app in smartphone has the following important UI elements:\n\nelement: open_note\n\tDescription: A button \"Open Note\";

Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.\n- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. \n- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.\n- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from \"up\", 'down\", \"left\", \"right\". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, \"down\"\n- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.\n- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include \"selected\", \"checked\", \"scrollable\", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])[\"selected\"].\n- back(): close the current window\n\n\nThe <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:\n- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button\n- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]\n\nThe <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:\n- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items\n- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match(\"key words\") or $my_items.match({\"selected\": true})\nYou can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.\n\nThe first state of the app has the following important UI elements: \n\topen_note\n\tcreate_note\n\tmore_options_checklist\n\tswitch_item\n\tswitch_to_prev_item\n\titem_title\n\tswitch_to_next_item\n\tchecklist_item_list\n\tchecklist_item\n\tchecklist_item\n\tadd_checklist_item\n\n\n\nNow I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.\nThe tasks are:\n\nTask 0: Open a checklist note or create one if there is none, then move the checklist item 'Buy Groceries' to the top of the list.\nTask 1: Ensure a note is open and then delete all text in the current note.\nTask 2: Verify the checklist contains the item 'Plan Vacation' and rename it to 'Book Flights'.\nTask 3: Open a checklist and then open more options for the current checklist\nTask 4: Add the text 'meeting notes' to the note and then search for the text 'meeting notes' within the current note.\n\nYour answer should follow this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"<task1>\": \"<script1>\",\n    \"<task2>\": \"<script2>\",\n    ...\n}\n\n**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**\n", "40": "A Notes app in smartphone has the following important UI elements:\n\nelement: open_note\n\tDescription: A button \"Open Note\";

Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.\n- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. \n- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.\n- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from \"up\", 'down\", \"left\", \"right\". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, \"down\"\n- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.\n- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include \"selected\", \"checked\", \"scrollable\", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])[\"selected\"].\n- back(): close the current window\n\n\nThe <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:\n- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button\n- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]\n\nThe <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:\n- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items\n- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match(\"key words\") or $my_items.match({\"selected\": true})\nYou can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.\n\nThe first state of the app has the following important UI elements: \n\topen_note\n\tcreate_note\n\tmore_options_checklist\n\tswitch_item\n\tswitch_to_prev_item\n\titem_title\n\tswitch_to_next_item\n\tchecklist_item_list\n\tchecklist_item\n\tchecklist_item\n\tadd_checklist_item\n\n\n\nNow I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.\nThe tasks are:\n\nTask 0: Open a checklist note if none are currently opened, then move the checklist item 'Read a Book' to the top of the list.\nTask 1: Open a note, make it the current note, and then search for 'important dates' within the current note.\nTask 2: Open a note (or create one if none exists) and edit the content of the note to say 'Meeting at 10am on Monday'\nTask 3: Create a checklist item 'Clean Room' if it does not exist, then delete the checklist item 'Clean Room'\nTask 4: Change the theme color of the app to White\n\nYour answer should follow this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"<task1>\": \"<script1>\",\n    \"<task2>\": \"<script2>\",\n    ...\n}\n\n**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**\n"}
