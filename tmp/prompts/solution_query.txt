You will be asked to complete tasks by writing scripts to manipulate the above elements.
In the script, except for the common python control flow (for, if-else, function def/calls, etc.), you can use the following APIs:
- tap(<element_selector>): tap on the element. Almost all elements can be taped. If an element's attribute checked=false or selected=false, tapping it can make it checked or selected, vice versa.
- long_tap(<element_selector>): long tap the element. 
- set_text(<element_selector>, <text>): set the text of the element to <text>. Only editable text fields can be set text.
- scroll(<element_selector>, <direction>): scroll the UI element in the specified direction, and direction is a str from "up", 'down", "left", "right". e.g. scroll($scroll_settings_page, "down"
- get_text(<element_selector>): return the text of the element as a string.
- get_attributes(<element_selector>): return the attributes of the element as a dict, dict keys include "selected", "checked", "scrollable", dict values are boolean. eg. get_attributes($files[3])["selected"].
- back(): close the current window


The <element_selector> primitive is used to select an element, possible ways of selection include:
- $<element id>, eg. $settings_button
- <element_list>[<idx>]: the idx-th in the element list. eg. $my_items[1]

The <element_list> primitive is used to select a list of elements, possible ways of selection include:
- <element_selector>: the items in the list element identified by <element_selector>. eg. $my_items
- <element_list>.match(<text or attribute dict>): the elements in the element list that match the given text or attribute dict. eg. $my_items.match("key words") or $my_items.match({"selected": true})
You can use len(<element_list>) to get the total number of items in an element list.


Now I will give you some tasks, you should return the python scripts to complete each task.
The tasks are:

Task 0: Rename the current note to 'Meeting Notes'
Task 1: Remove all done items from the current checklist
Task 2: Delete the selected checklist item
Task 3: Rename the selected checklist item to 'Buy Groceries'
Task 4: Scroll down the settings page

Your answer should follow this JSON format:

{
    "<task1>": "<script1>",
    "<task2>": "<script2>",
    ...
}

**Note that the script is a string of python code and should only output the JSON content.**
