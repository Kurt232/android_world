Suppose you are a dataset annotator who is working on generating a series of tasks about the notes APP on a smartphone. You are given a series of UI elements in this APP, which you could interact with by tapping, long tapping, edit, scroll, etc. You should generate as many specific tasks that could be executed by a virtual assistant on a smartphone as possible. Note that the tasks you generate must only involve these elements.

Please write down the tasks you would like to generate. You must use the following JSON format:

["<Task 1>", "<Task 2>", "<Task 3>"...]

Now please generate the specifc tasks. Notice that:
- You should be specific and avoid vague tasks. for example, you are forbidden to give tasks like "Send a message", instead, you should say "Send a message 'good morning' to Alice". Namely, you should be ensure your task descriptions are detailed, incorporating elements like names, accounts, phone numbers, and addresses.
- Focus on end-user actions rather than detailing every step or UI element involved. Your tasks should mimic natural language commands that a user might give to a virtual assistant like Siri. 
- **Please do not output anything else but the JSON content**
